## Develop Content based on topics listed in repo (Main Push)
	- just go into the repo
	- find a topic you want to work on.
	- check issues to see if the topic is already claimed
	- IF NOT, submit an issue and claim it to show its being worked.
	- IF IT IS, reach out to the assignee and see if you can work on it together OR find a new topic.
	- Checkout/create a new branch "dev-<yourname>"
	- search google, and get the info
	- copy a template directory 
	- generate content for your topic
	- when ready, submit as a pull request to the QA branch, assign a maintainer to the pull request.
	- fix any issues if pull request is rejected

## Expand Topics in Domains
	- I've created a list of topics in a rough draft right now, but it could be expanded. 
	- Take a look at each of the sections and try to come up with any ideas I may have forgotten or ignored. 

## Help to better structure the Chapters/Sections
	- Currently there is no actual structur to how the chapters will be presented. 
	- Any input is welcome, but it needs to be logical and repeatable in each of the other chapters/sections.

## Help to become a Maintainer in the GitHub Repo
	- Need to be able to QA any Pull Requests
	- Need to have a familiarity with GitHub & Git
	- Need to be able to review w/in ~24hrs and respond ~48hrs
	- Focus on good grammar, and quality of content w/ respect to the current CTF environment.

## Help Develop curriculum path
	- This is less concrete, we are currently aligning with a CTF program CyberUp is using, but we may eventually develop an improved curriculum.
	- Try to suggest course corrections, specifying things like better "logical order of learning", or more relevant to developing industry requirements, or better for passing certs.

## Help to develop the GitHub repo as a tool
	- Need better communcation/discussion boards
	- Need better Team setups
	- Need improved automation & QA processes, potential for CI/CD need too

## Help to develop or offer an alternative to Slack for Instructor/Student communcations
	- Some schools block Slack at their firewalls, need alternatives. 
	- Try to provide some sort of comparison, with focus on allowing the schools to whitelist while minimizing the operational load CyberUp would have to take on. 

## Help to teach/instruct
	- Middle School
	- High School (main push)
	- Adult learners/ Career transitioners
