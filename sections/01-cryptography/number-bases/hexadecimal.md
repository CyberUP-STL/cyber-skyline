#  What is Hexadecimal?
Hexadecimal numerals are widely used by computer systems and software engineers because they provide a human-friendly representation of binary-coded values. 

#### Example of Hexadecimal
```
Binary    H    E    X    
00000000  57 69 6b 69 70 65 64 69  61 2c 20 74 68 65 20 66  
00000010  72 65 65 20 65 6e 63 79  63 6c 6f 70 65 64 69 61  
00000020  20 74 68 61 74 20 61 6e  79 6f 6e 65 20 63 61 6e 
00000030  20 65 64 69 74 0a
```

# How does it work?
Each hexadecimal digit represents four bits (binary digits), also known as a nibble (or nybble), which is 1/2 of a byte. For example, a single byte can have values ranging from 00000000 to 11111111 in binary form, which can be conveniently represented as 00 to FF in hexadecimal.
